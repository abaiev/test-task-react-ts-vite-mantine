# React + TypeScript + Vite + Mantine

## Overview
This project is a test task for a job application. I have been given the following task.

```text
1. I've attached a file to this job application called 'mockup.png'
2. Use React + Mantine + Vite framework to build a simple version of this mockup. It should take ~30 minutes to 1 hour to complete this.
3. Submit a screenshot / video of what you built + the interaction. If it goes well, we'd love to hire you for this role.
```

## Time Spent
I spent approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes on this task. Please note that I was not previously familiar with the Mantine concept, which contributed to the additional time spent.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
